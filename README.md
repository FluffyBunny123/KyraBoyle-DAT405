Marvel Heroes 
you need to download a server extenshion for this to work.
With my JSON I did a simple log on one of the characters to discover its potential then I started with deciding what I would do, I choose to style my work on top trumps so you have links for the different superheroes and then it relays the information of the name, how many comics they have and a short description on them, I made a link from the HTML main page which went to the link for the different superheroes, after I achieved this I then realised the front page was not interesting so I added the pictures on the bottom, I then made them move and fly around the page it sort of gives them a fighting effect which I thought worked well with the superheroes theme.

 Calling on the picture from the JSON was the biggest issue with this work, it wasnâ€™t as easy as doing the text and you had to have a lot of knowledge and a lot of patience to achieve getting it to appear, and then getting it to move was worse but with a lot of research and patience it was achievable, in future I think I will want to explore the JSON more to see what more I can do then just the simple looking stuff.
